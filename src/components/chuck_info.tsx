  // const ChuckJoke = () => <>... some JSX Here...</>;

  // Instead, this component uses curly braces `{}` and a `return` statement

  // This allows us to write code here to perform some logic before we construct
  // the JSX we want to return

  // If you don't have any particular need to write TypeScript/JavaScript logic
  // in a component, then it's cleaner to use the implicit return style from
  // <ChuckJoke/>
